GRUDU : Grid Reservation Utility for Deployment Usage (http://grudu.gforge.inria.fr)

version 1.1.3 : 

* News : GRUDU is now available on the INRIA GForge ! 

* Bug corrections : (http://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?atid=4989&group_id=1253&func=browse)

 - 7601 : Added the used of the command passed in the properties to the
JCTerm. Now the command is executed after having logged on the
fronted of the node.

 - 7602 : it seems that types and queues were misused. 
GRUDU now looks at the types to see whether the job is of the following types 'allow_classic_ssh" or "deploy".
If it is the cas then the job uses ssh, else it used oarsh to log on the job.
Moreover there was a problem in the copy command used to transfer the jar file from the preferred access frontend to the frontend of the job.

 - 7603 : The command line used in the UnixLauncher.sh has been modified to take into account the solution for the "grey box" bug.
Here is the new command line : 
export AWT_TOOLKIT=MToolkit; java $* -jar GRUDU.jar

A new feature has been added at the same time : you can now specify parameters that can be given to the java command.
For example memory : -Xmx1024m -Xms1024m with the following command:

$ ./UnixLauncher.sh -Xmx1024m -Xms1024m

 - 7605 : - Problem : when site with node having disk/swap/memory are displayed an error was thrown with the meterchart asking only maximum value strictly positive.
  - Solution : when a node has not strickly positive values for total disk/memory/swap space, a message is written on the jpanel instead of the classical chart and a error message is displayed in the standard error.
This message is the proof of a problem on the distant machine.

* Updates : 

 - Sources are now compatible with the eclipse project management
 - Clean up concerning the extraction of GRUDU from the DIET DashBoard
 - Update of the Grid'5000 configuration
 - Adding an option (-D 4) for kadeploy output information 

version 1.1.2 : 

* Bugs correction (http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) :

 - bug 53 : when installing or using GRUDU there was a problem connecting to the
  rennes site, because of the use of the former naming convention. Now that the
  new one is applied, GRUDU uses addresses starting with access.

* Updates :

 - updating the number of nodes for the sagittaire cluster of the Lyon site.

version 1.1.1 :

* Bugs correction (http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) : 

 - bug 47 : the grid'5000 time in the reservation frame is nomore taken from the
 preferred access frontale but from the actual access frontale. If this fails the time
 is computed based on the local machien time.
 
 - bug 48 : the deploy jobs were displayed as default jobs. This bug is now resolved.
 the parsing was not well realized (the type variable was used instead of the types 
 variable).

version 1.1.0 :

* New features :

 - OAR2 & OAR1 compliant
 - Ganglia features (site & job levels)
 - JFTP Module
 - The user can now be aware of the number of nodes he/she has reserved
 - the SSH passphrase is now stores in memory and no more in a file
 - OARGridSub beahaviour available
 - the user can now run a script at the reservation start-up.
 
* Updates :

 - Update of the User's Manual for GRUDU. Also available at 
 http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/DIET/wiki/doku.php?id=grudu:grudu_grid_5000_reservation_utility_for_deployment_usage
  and https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/GRUDU
  
 - Update of the GRUDU Help.

* Correction of bugs (http//graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) : 

 - bug 37 : It was about the wrong number of nodes on Nancy. In fact, it was a 
 problem of properties when reserving some nodes. Now you have a extra panel in 
 the reservation frame that allows you to specify some properties for each clusters.
 
 - bug 39 : Allows the OAR grid sub behaviour when reserving (It means that when
 you want to reserve on the grid, if one of the reservation fails, all the 
 already realized jobs are deleted). The choice is realized at the reservation time 
 by checking/uncheking a checkbox in the reservation panel.
  
 - bug 40 : To solve the lack of reservation status after the submission, a 
 reservation status frame has been added. It displays the statuses of the different
 submissions realized by this reservation.
 
 - bug 45 : The date and time are now fixed relatively to the CET (Central European
 Timezone) Timezone, the one of Grid'5000.
 
 - bug 38 : Explanations are now given to the user concerning the information asked
 during the installation. These are mandatory for the creation of remote hierarchies 
 of files on Grid'5000 used for operations such as the deployment of images through
 Kadeploy.
