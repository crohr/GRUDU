GRUDU : Grid Reservation Utility for Deployment Usage (http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/DIET/grudu.html)

version 1.1.2 : 

* Bugs correction (http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) :

 - bug 53 : when installing or using GRUDU there was a problem connecting to the
  rennes site, because of the use of the former naming convention. Now that the
  new one is applied, GRUDU uses addresses starting with access.

* Updates :

 - updating the number of nodes for the sagittaire cluster of the Lyon site.

version 1.1.1 :

* Bugs correction (http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) : 

 - bug 47 : the grid'5000 time in the reservation frame is nomore taken from the
 preferred access frontale but from the actual access frontale. If this fails the time
 is computed based on the local machien time.
 
 - bug 48 : the deploy jobs were displayed as default jobs. This bug is now resolved.
 the parsing was not well realized (the type variable was used instead of the types 
 variable).

version 1.1.0 :

* New features :

 - OAR2 & OAR1 compliant
 - Ganglia features (site & job levels)
 - JFTP Module
 - The user can now be aware of the number of nodes he/she has reserved
 - the SSH passphrase is now stores in memory and no more in a file
 - OARGridSub beahaviour available
 - the user can now run a script at the reservation start-up.
 
* Updates :

 - Update of the User's Manual for GRUDU. Also available at 
 http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/DIET/wiki/doku.php?id=grudu:grudu_grid_5000_reservation_utility_for_deployment_usage
  and https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/index.php/GRUDU
  
 - Update of the GRUDU Help.

* Correction of bugs (http//graal.ens-lyon.fr/bugzilla) : 

 - bug 37 : It was about the wrong number of nodes on Nancy. In fact, it was a 
 problem of properties when reserving some nodes. Now you have a extra panel in 
 the reservation frame that allows you to specify some properties for each clusters.
 
 - bug 39 : Allows the OAR grid sub behaviour when reserving (It means that when
 you want to reserve on the grid, if one of the reservation fails, all the 
 already realized jobs are deleted). The choice is realized at the reservation time 
 by checking/uncheking a checkbox in the reservation panel.
  
 - bug 40 : To solve the lack of reservation status after the submission, a 
 reservation status frame has been added. It displays the statuses of the different
 submissions realized by this reservation.
 
 - bug 45 : The date and time are now fixed relatively to the CET (Central European
 Timezone) Timezone, the one of Grid'5000.
 
 - bug 38 : Explanations are now given to the user concerning the information asked
 during the installation. These are mandatory for the creation of remote hierarchies 
 of files on Grid'5000 used for operations such as the deployment of images through
 Kadeploy.
