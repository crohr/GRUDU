NOTE: This file is outdated, please take a look at the sourceforge feature request site
      if you are interested in what's going on or even want to help improving JFtp.

H		- bugs and feature requests submitted on sourceforge
		  (work still in progress, i won't list all of them here, but they aren't forgotten)

H		- implement timestamping to make up/download resuming safe

HF		- add ftp mget support (1 vote)
		  (i looked at it and it is an interesting feature)

M		- further enhance the GUI

M		- add parameter checks for the api
		  (all given parameters for up/download/remove etc. should be plain files or dirs,
		  no relative or absolutet paths, so do a chdir before doing anything if you use the api
		  and want to be on the safe side)

M 		- popup for upload resuming

MB		- fix SFTP symlink support (1 vote)

M 		- improve NFS support
		  (mutithreading is not implemented yet
		  and it does not work with some servers - need debug info first)

MF		- enhance local and implement remote JFileChooser (1 vote)
		  (not that easy, i have to find a way to extend JFileChooser or
		  to write a new class)

MU		- enhance downloadmanager support for SMB and SFTP and URL types
		  (it depends on the protocol if features  like resuming and multiple conenctions are supported.
		  some apis do not support resuming for example, for others it is imho not so important to have
		  it so i do not implement it until somebody needs it - SMB for example, because most connections
		  will be fast (lan) connections)

L		- enable all supported protocols on the address bar
		  (open urls ending with a / in the remote window, done for http/ftp)

--------------------------------------	Notes	------------------------------------------------


- the server you want to open is not yet supported? just fill out a feature request a we will see what we can do
- group permissions are not checked, it's possible that a file the user has access to is marked incorrect in very rare cases.
  you are able to download the file even if it's marked red in such a case, of course. if one or more hardlinks in a directory are
  missing this may cause the permissions not to be displayed due to malformed ls output, too
- Kunststoff is listed twice sometimes (seems not to be my fault)
- check windows-server-code (downloads.viaarena.com), VMS-server-code (rf1.cuis.edu)
